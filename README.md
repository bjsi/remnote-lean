## RemNote Lean

### Features

- Prove mathematical theorems using the [Lean interactive theorem proving language](https://leanprover.github.io/) side-by-side with your RemNote notes!

### Resources

- [Logic and Proof](https://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/): An introduction to logic and proof using Lean!
- [The Natural Number Game](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game): Build the natural numbers from scratch in Lean!
- Coming Soon: Mathematics for the 21st Century - my intro to logic and proof using Lean and RemNote!

### Usage

- Tag a statement you would like to prove with the Lean Proof powerup by using the `Lean Proof` command in the omnibar.
- This will open a new pane containing a code editor where you can write your proof.
- The goal state is shown beneath the code editor.
